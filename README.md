# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results. (+3pt)
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page. (+2pt)

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [X] Added star functionality to individual tableview cell (+2pt)
- [X] Added customized scope filtering functions under search bar (+2pt)

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. One difficult thing was that the demo project came in Swift 3, and I was writing in Swift 4 so using scopes and 
   search bars were a bit of a hassle that's why the UI may seem a bit off at first

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. Definitely the search and the scope filter 
took a bit of time due to language conversion.
